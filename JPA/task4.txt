We get next info as JSON from server.

Models:  Employee, EmployeeStatus, Address, Personal, Project, Unit

Take into account the following:

    EmployeeStatus should be Enum type
    Address should be embedded to Employee object
    Relationship between Employee and EmployeePersonalInfo should be one-to-one
    Relationship between Employee and Project should be many-to-many
    Relationship between Unit and Employee should be one-to-many

You need to generate json, process them and store to cache.

http://www.json-generator.com/  - you can use this generator.

Use several ORM from list to implement and compare

    XCORE (https://github.com/IstiN/android_xcore)
    ORMLite (https://github.com/j256/ormlite-android)
    Realm (http://realm.io/)
    Other...

Please test which provides better speed (provide results) to write / read values.

Which needs less code for implementation?

Implement methods which provides:

    Create Employee / Unit / Project
    Find employee / Unit / Project by id
    Delete employee / Unit / Project by id
    Update Employee / Unit / Project by id
    Add Employee to Unit by id’s
    Assign Employee for Project by id’s
